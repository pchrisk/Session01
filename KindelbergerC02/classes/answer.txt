1. Explain the modulo operator. You may need to consult more resources (online Java language resources, other Java books, etc.) to find out the details.
The modulo operator is the remainder operator. It is nothing more than the remainder after a division operations. 
In Java (along with C and C++ it is represented as the percent sign.

For Example, 10 modulo 2 is 0, because 10 divided by 2 is 5 with a remainder of 0.

2. What is the result of the expression (8 % 3) ?
8 % 3 = 2

3. What are all possible results of the expression (n % 5), where n is an integer variable?
-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4


4. What are all possible results of the expression (n % m), where n and m are integer variables? 
The range from -(m-1) to (m-1)

In the previous question this would be the range from -(5-1) to (5-1) or -4 to 4 inclusive.
