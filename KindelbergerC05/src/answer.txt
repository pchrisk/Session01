What are the fundamental difference between composition and inheritance?
composition is an "has a" relationship. ie, car has an engine
inheritance is a "is a" relationship. ie, Tesla is a car 


What is delegation and how is it related to wrapper classes.
Delegation is an abstraction mechanism which centralizes object (method) behavior.
Wrapper classes  have the purpose of simplifying and centralizing methods. IE, Integer class for dealing with int.
