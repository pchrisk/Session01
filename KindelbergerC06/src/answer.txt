How does inheritance break encapsulation? 
Potentially the inheritance could open up or allow access to something that was not intended to be accessed. So it is important
the privilege of inheritance not be abused.


What are static and dynamic types and how are they different?
Static type is compile time and dynamic is run time. An object can be set as a type at compile time (static) but then can be 
later modified while the program is running (dynamic). Class A if extended by Class B, then an object can be declared as an object
of type A but then be replaces with an object of type B during run time.
